# Reversi Game

This project contains a browser-based implementation of a Reversi game built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Getting Started

- Open `index.html` in any modern browser to launch the game.
- Place disks by clicking a highlighted square. The application automatically flips bracketed disks and passes when a player has no valid moves.
- Use the **Reset** button to restart the match at any time.
